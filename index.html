  <h1>Extremal Inscribed Polygons</h1>
  <h2>subtitle</h2>
  <div>
    <p>
      In this webpage, we will describe algorithms to find the convex polygons inscribed in a given convex n-gon
      (An n-gon being a polygon with n sides. In the context of this work, n >= 5) of minimal area and perimeter.
      In order to do this, we will describe and explain a series of theorems and lemmas that will define how said
      algorithms will function.

    <h2>Inscribed Convex Polygons</h2>
    <p>
      ...But what are polygons inscribed in other polygons?
    </p>
    <p>
      Those reading this may be familiar with polygons inscribed in circles; polygons whose every vertex is part of a
      certain circle.
      The rationale behind inscribing polygons into other polygons is similar, but with some more restrictions.
      Specifically, for a polygon Q
      inscribed in a polygon C:<br>
      > Every vertex of Q must be on an edge of C<br>
      > Every edge of C must contain <i>at least</i> one vertex of Q (For the purpose of this exercise you can assume,
      without loss of generality, that every edge of C contains exactly 1 vertex of Q). Importantly, note that the
      vertices of Q
      are allowed to overlap.<br><br>
      Below, you can find a couple examples of polygons inscribed (and not inscribed) into a regular pentagon: <br>
      Figure 1.a: The polygon composed by all the midpoints of the sides of the pentagon is an inscribed polygon.
      As we will see later, of all polygons inscribed in a regular pentagon, it is also the one that has the smallest
      perimeter. <br>
      Figure 1.b: This polygon is also an inscribed polygon, as points q<sub>1</sub> (on edge
      p<sub>1</sub>p<sub>2</sub>) and q<sub>5</sub>
      (on edge p5p1) are overlapping on point p<sub>1</sub>,
      and points q2 and q3 are also overlapping on point p<sub>3</sub>. As with 1.a, this also happens to be an extremal
      polygon, except this time it is
      (one of) the polygons with the smallest area. <br>
      Figure 1.c: Unlike the two before, this polygon is not inscribed in the pentagon, as no edges of Q are on edges
      p<sub>1</sub>p<sub>2</sub> and p<sub>4</sub>p<sub>5</sub>.

    <h2>Some other assumptions...</h2>
    <p>
      For the purposed of clarity and brevity, here are some statements that will remain true throughout: <br>
      > All polygons discussed are <i>convex</i> polygons. i.e, polygons such that every line between any 2 points in
      the polygon
      is either entirely inside the polygon, or part of its boundary. <br>
      > Polygon Q, composed of points q<sub>1</sub>, q<sub>2</sub>, ..., q<sub>k</sub> is inscribed in polygon C,
      composed of points p<sub>1</sub>, p<sub>2</sub>, ..., p<sub>n</sub>. <br>
      > All points are in counter-clockwise order. <br>
      > We define s<sup>C</sup>(Q) = {U, N}<sup>n</sup>, which describe a cyclical sequence of n elements, corresponding
      to whether each vertex of C
      contains a vertex of Q (U), or not (N). <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, the sequence s<sup>C</sup>(Q) corresponding to Figure 1.a is {N, N, N, N, N}
      and the sequence for Figure 1.b is {U, N, U, U, N}. <br>

    <h2>Minimum Area Inscribed Polygons</h2>
    <p>
      This relatively simple algorithm stems from this singular theorem: <br> <br>
      <b>Theorem 1</b> <br>
      <i>
        Let Q be a minimum area convex polygon inscribed in C: <br> <br>
        (i) Q has no two consecutive vertices that are interior points of some sides of C. <br>
        (ii) If q<sub>j</sub> is a vertex of Q contained in the interior of p<sub>i</sub>p<sub>i+1</sub>,
        then the vertices of Q adjacent to q<sub>j</sub> are p<sub>i-1</sub> and p<sub>i+2</sub>, and is parallel to
        p<sub>i</sub>p<sub>i+1</sub>. <br>
        (iii) There is a minimum area convex polygon Q<sub>0</sub> inscribed in C, with vertices 
        q'<sub>1</sub>, q'<sub>2</sub>,..., q'<sub>k</sub>, such that<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- q<sub>j</sub> is a vertex of C if and only if q<sub>j</sub> = q'<sub>j</sub>, and<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- if q<sub>j</sub> is an interior point of p<sub>i</sub>p<sub>i+1</sub>, then 
        q'<sub>j</sub> ∈ {p<sub>i</sub>, p<sub>i+1</sub>}.
